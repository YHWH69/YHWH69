Hi, I'm YHWH. It is nice to have you on my GitHub.
I have a background in psychological research and have a special interest in the assessment of serious violent and sexual offenders. 

Growing up, I always had an interest in computers and first made attempts to switch to linux-based OS and to learn code
as a young teenager, although never found much success. Recently, I have been getting back into some simple programming and
I have been spending some time getting into python and some other simple languages. 

I am excited to see what GitHub has to offer, and what I can offer to the community in return. 

YWHW.
